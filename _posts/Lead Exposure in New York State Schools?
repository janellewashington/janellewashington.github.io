The dangers of lead exposure, especially for children, are well-known. Lead contamination in pipes are partially alarming because lead in these pipes can be dissolved in the water. This water is then used for daily activities, such as drinking, and cooking. In addition, children can absorb lead much easier than adults. Over time, this can have devastating effects including mental and physical delays as well as poisoning. 

For my first project, I analyzed a dataset related to this issue. I stumbled upon this dataset, which shows the results of testing New York State schools' pipes for lead. This is important because one would not willingly send one's child to an environment that could be threatening to the child's health. Moreover, I felt this potential issue can be overlooked because, in my experience, when doctors screen for lead exposure, they typically ask questions that assess the child's exposure to lead at home. Therefore, many children who are constantly exposed to lead in school may be left out. This then leads to a bigger issue of children not being able to get much needed treatment. 

Upon obtaining with this data, my question is should we be worried about the amount of lead in New York State Schools' pipelines? According to the World Health Organization, there is no safe amount of lead for anyone to be exposed to. However, levels of lead in pipes equal to or greater than 5 parts per billion requires action. Furthermore, at levels of lead in pipes greater than 15 parts per billion, it is federally mandated that the pipes are replaced. In order

The dataset contained the results of testing the amount of lead present in water samples from thousands of schools within New York State. First, to answer my aforementioned question, I looked at the amount of schools in the dataset that had any buildings with lead-free plumbing in the facility. The results are depicted in this in a pie chart, which was noteworthy:



To ensure that misleading information is not presented,  I then followed this up by showing this same data in bar chart:



As shown, a very small amount of schools had buildings with lead-free plumbing in the facility. Only about .47% of schools fell into this category. What is particularly alarming is the schools had an average about 85 outlets sampled. That said, the school could have only one building with lead-free pipes but have all of the other buildings containing pipes contaminated with lead. This is very concerning.  


I also then thought it would be interesting to look at differences among the data by region. No particular region was found to have more schools with a higher concentration of lead-contaminated pipes. In other words, results painted a bleak picture for the entire state as a whole.  Here is a heat map of counties in New York State schools that had a higher amount of lead in their outlets sampled:




Based on the aforementioned information, the issue of lead exposure in schools needs more attention. All of the testing included here began in 2016. Therefore, the results are fairly recent.  Over time, further research needs to be done. Nevertheless, as it is, the ultimate answer to my question is yes, we should be worried about lead exposure in New York State schools.
