How Prevalent is Lead in NYS Schools?

The dangers of lead exposure, especially for children, are well-known. Lead contamination in pipes are partially alarming because lead in these pipes can be dissolved in the water. This water is then used for daily activities, such as drinking, cleaning, and cleaning. In addition, children absorb iron much easier than adults. Over time, this can have devastating effects including mental and physical delays as well as poisoning. 

For my first project, I analyzed a dataset related to this issue. I stumbled upon "this"(https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Lead-Testing-in-School-Drinking-Water-Sampling-and/rkyy-fsv9) dataset, which shows the 2016 results of testing New York State schools' pipes for lead. This is important because one would not willingly send one's child to an environment that could be threatening to the child's health. Moreover, I felt this potential issue can be overlooked because, in my experience, when doctors screen for lead exposure, they typically ask questions that assess the child's exposure to lead at home. Therefore, many children who are constantly exposed to lead in school may be left out. This then leads to a bigger issue of children not being able to get much needed treatment. 

First, I looked at the amount of schools in the dataset that actually had lead-free buildings in the facility. First, I showed this in a pie chart, which was noteworthy:



To ensure that misleading information is not presented,  I then followed this up by showing this same data in bar chart:



As shown, a very small amount of schools had lead-free buildings.



I also thought it would be interesting to look at differences among the data by region. Here is a heat map of counties in New York State schools that had a higher number of lead in their outlets:




Based on the aforementioned information, the issue of lead exposure in schools needs more attention. Over time, more research needs to be done.
